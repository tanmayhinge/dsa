Job created A | deadline = 2 | profit = 100
Job created B | deadline = 1 | profit = 19
Job created C | deadline = 2 | profit = 27
Job created D | deadline = 1 | profit = 25
Job created E | deadline = 3 | profit = 15

Step 1 - sorting the jobs in descending order based on their profit values:

100 27 25 19 15 

choose jobs based on whether the slot is filled or not.

At job A deadline is 2
free slot found 1
value present is False
since slot[1] is false, we choose job A

At job C deadline is 2
free slot found 1
value present is True
free slot found 0
value present is False
since slot[0] is false, we choose job C

At job D deadline is 1
free slot found 0
value present is True

At job B deadline is 1
free slot found 0
value present is True

At job E deadline is 3
free slot found 2
value present is False
since slot[2] is false, we choose job E
